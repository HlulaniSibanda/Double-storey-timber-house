<img width="987" height="717" alt="01_3D_Structure_Overview" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6f44cd7-42d5-4267-9bf4-3aab4ddbca59" />

## Project Overview

This project presents the complete structural design, modeling, and analysis of a double-storey timber residential house developed using professional BIM and structural analysis workflows.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate real-world structural engineering capability suitable for international freelance work, particularly US-based residential and light commercial structural projects.

The model includes:

* Structural layout and load paths
* Timber framing system
* Roof truss system
* Foundation design
* Connection detailing
* Structural analysis using Autodesk Robot Structural Analysis

This project is for portfolio and demonstration purposes only.

## Project Objectives

* Develop a structurally sound timber residential system
* Demonstrate professional BIM workflow using Revit
* Perform structural analysis using Robot Structural Analysis
* Produce calculation-backed engineering decisions
* Create permit-style drawing sheets and connection details
* Showcase international-standard structural engineering workflow

---

## Software Used

* Autodesk Revit 2026.4 → BIM modelling & structural drawings
* Autodesk Robot Structural Analysis 2026 → Structural analysis
* AutoCAD (optional) → Detailing & sheet exports

---

## Structural System Summary

### Foundation

* Isolated reinforced concrete pad footings
* Reinforced concrete columns
* Load transfer directly from timber frame to foundation

### Superstructure

* Double-storey timber framing
* Structural beams aligned with grid load paths
* Load-bearing perimeter and internal walls

### Roof System

* Timber roof trusses
* Regular spacing across structure
* Full load path to columns and foundations

### Connections Modeled

* Column-to-footing anchorage
* Beam-to-column connections
* Truss bearing details
* Steel brackets and anchor bolts
* Conceptual hold-downs and restraints

---

## Structural Analysis (Robot)

Analysis performed using:

* Dead loads
* Live loads
* Roof loads
* Load combinations
* Support reactions
* Member forces
* Deflection checks

Outputs captured:

* Bending moments
* Shear forces
* Axial forces
* Displacements
* Support reactions

All analysis performed using professional engineering workflow.
